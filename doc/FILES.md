# Perl Executing Browser QtWebEngine - Files and Folders

## Application Executable

The executable binary file of the browser, ``peb`` by default, can be renamed with no restrictions or additional adjustments. It can take the name of the PEB-based application it is going to run.

## Application Files and Folders

PEB is created to work from any directory without installation and all file paths used by PEB are relative to the directory of the PEB executable, labeled as ``{PEB_executable_directory}`` within this documentation.  

The following PEB files and folders are hard-coded in C++ code for faster application startup.  
The PEB application directory is compatible with the application directory of the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework.  

A minimal ``{PEB_executable_directory}`` looks like this:

```bash
.
├── {PEB_executable}
└── resources
    └── app
        ├── index.html
        └── app.png
```

* **Application Directory:**  
  The application directory path must be: ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app``  
  All Perl scripts started by PEB must be located within this directory and its subdirectories.  
  The working directory of all PEB Perl scripts is the application directory.  

  * **Start Page:**  
    Start page pathname must be: ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app/index.html``  
    If start page is missing, an error message is displayed.  

  <a name="icon"></a>
  * **Icon:**
    Icon pathname must be: ``{PEB_executable_directory}/resources/app/app.png``  
    If icon file is found on application startup, it is used as application icon.  
    If icon file is not found, the default icon embedded in the resources of the browser binary is used.
